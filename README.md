Welcome to AI-SustainableLiving, an application that utilizes artificial intelligence to promote sustainable living practices. This repository contains code and resources related to predicting sustainability factors and providing recommendations for environmentally friendly actions.

## About AI-SustainableLiving

AI-SustainableLiving is a project developed by Dr. Layla Bennett, aimed at leveraging AI to enhance awareness and adoption of sustainable practices. The project includes AI models that predict sustainability factors based on environmental data, as well as a recommendation system that suggests personalized actions to users.

## Features

- Predict Sustainability Factors: The AI model predicts sustainability factors, such as carbon footprint and energy consumption, based on real-time environmental data.

- Personalized Recommendations: Users receive personalized recommendations for sustainable actions they can take to reduce their environmental impact.

- Data Visualization: Environmental data and sustainability predictions are visualized through graphs and charts for easy understanding.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main.py` script to launch the AI-SustainableLiving application.

## Usage

1. Launch the application using `python main.py`.
2. Choose options from the main menu to create a user profile, predict sustainability factors, get recommendations, or exit the application.

## Data Management

- User Profiles: User profiles and preferences are stored in `data/user_profiles.json`.

- Environmental Data: Environmental data collected from users is stored in `data/environmental_data.json`.

- Sustainability Recommendations: Sustainability recommendations are stored in `data/sustainability_recommendations.json`.
